			<h2> The Personal Page </h2>
			<p> <strong>Hi there, My names Michaela Tuor.</strong><br>
			 I was born and raised in Canada's Capital City, Ottawa Ontario.
			 Travelling is something that I love and I hope to get out and explore the world someday. That being said for now travelling to my cottage every free moment I have will have to do!
			 It is where I get to do one of my all time favorite pass times; Getting lost withing the world of books. Furthermore, with all the nature surrounding me it is a great place to pull inspriation out of for my designs. 
			 Competive Curling is what I grewing up knowing and has been an active part of my life since before I can remember. It's a great sport that really challenges you, and I wouldnt be who I am today without it.
			 I graduated merivale high school from the Communications and Design Focus Program. 
			 I knew after that, that Graphic Design was my passion and enrolled into Algonquin Colleges Graphic Design Program where I have been studying for going on three years in a hopes to someday work as a graphic designer .</p>
			
			<p> <strong>Why I am a Designer</strong><br>
			I decided to become a designer at first because it was what I was good at. Slowly the more I learn and grow as a designer its become more of a passion and now I hope to make a difference and help people with design.
